## Submitting a Pull Request

If you wish to submit a pull request for a new feature or issue, you should start by forking this repository first. This should get you setup on your local machine:

### Setup

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) if you have not already
- Fork the repo
- `git clone https://github.com/*yourusername*/ofx-data-extractor.git && cd ofx-data-extractor`
- `npm install`
- `npm run test`

One you have done this, create a new branch with a name that loosely describes the issue on which you will be working. Once you think you have the addressed the issue in question, submit a pull request to the `main` branch.
